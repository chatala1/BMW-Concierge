<summary><h3>‚öôÔ∏è Development & Deployment</h3></summary>

### Local Development Setup

#### Quick Start
```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.2.0/bin:$PATH"
gem install --user-install jekyll bundler minima jekyll-feed

# Build the site
jekyll build

# Start development server
jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4000
```

#### Development Server Access
- Local URL: `http://localhost:4000/BMW-Concierge/`
- Auto-regeneration enabled for file changes
- Build time: ~0.5 seconds (very fast)

### GitHub Actions Setup Implementation

The BMW Concierge application uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment with specific setup requirements to ensure proper functionality before any firewall restrictions are applied.

#### Deployment Configuration Files

##### `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`
Enhanced Jekyll workflow with pre-firewall setup steps including:
- Environment variable configuration
- Firewall allowlist setup
- Dependency pre-validation
- Network connectivity checks

##### `.github/firewall-config.yml`
Comprehensive firewall configuration defining network allowlist for:
- GitHub services (github.com, api.github.com)
- Authentication endpoints (OAuth flows)
- External APIs (Smartcar, BMW resources)
- Build dependencies (RubyGems, Jekyll)
- GitHub Pages deployment

##### `.github/actions-setup-steps.yml`
Detailed setup steps configuration including:
- Ordered execution steps
- Environment preparation
- Network validation
- Error handling strategies
- Security configurations

#### Setup Steps Execution Order

1. **Environment Variables Configuration**
   - Set JEKYLL_ENV=production
   - Configure BMW_CONCIERGE_VERSION
   - Set Ruby gem paths

2. **Firewall Allowlist Application**
   - GitHub services allowlist
   - Authentication endpoints
   - External API access
   - Build dependencies

3. **Dependency Pre-validation**
   - GitHub API connectivity check
   - RubyGems repository access
   - Optional service availability

4. **Build Environment Preparation**
   - Ruby version verification
   - Jekyll environment setup
   - Asset compilation preparation

### Network Dependencies

#### Critical (Required)
- **GitHub API** (`api.github.com`) - OAuth authentication
- **RubyGems** (`rubygems.org`) - Jekyll dependencies
- **GitHub Services** (`github.com`) - Repository access

#### Optional (Non-blocking)
- **Smartcar API** (`smartcar.com`) - Vehicle integration
- **BMW Resources** (`bmw.com`) - Brand links

### Network Requirements & Firewall Allowlist

The following URLs need to be added to your firewall allowlist for proper functionality:

#### Smartcar Dashboard Configuration
- `https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/dashboard-config`
- Required for Smartcar API integration and vehicle connection setup

#### GitHub OAuth
- `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
- `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
- `https://api.github.com/user`

#### Smartcar OAuth
- `https://connect.smartcar.com/oauth/authorize`
- `https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token`
- `https://api.smartcar.com/`

### Security Considerations

- TLS verification enabled for all connections
- Certificate validation required
- Network request logging for monitoring
- Exponential backoff for retry strategies

### Testing Deployment
- Push changes to main branch triggers auto-deployment
- GitHub Actions handles the complete build and deployment process
- Deployment time: 2-3 minutes from push to live

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Issues
If builds fail after implementing setup changes:
1. Check workflow logs for network connectivity issues
2. Verify firewall allowlist is properly applied
3. Review dependency status messages
4. Ensure all critical services are accessible

#### Local Development Issues
1. **"The minima theme could not be found"**:
   ```bash
   gem install --user-install minima jekyll-feed
   ```

2. **"jekyll: command not found"**:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.2.0/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Development server not accessible**:
   - Ensure using `--host 0.0.0.0` flag
   - Check correct URL: `http://localhost:4000/BMW-Concierge/`

#### Expected Warnings
These warnings are normal and can be ignored:
- SASS deprecation warnings about `@import` and color functions
- Console errors about blocked Google Fonts (expected in development)

### API Transparency and Demo Mode Implementation

This document describes the implementation of API transparency features and demo mode indicators to address the fake API functionality concerns.

#### Issue Addressed

The BMW Concierge dashboard was displaying dynamically changing data that appeared to come from real APIs but was actually simulated/fake data. This created confusion about whether the application was truly connected to vehicle APIs.

#### Solution Implemented

##### 1. Vehicle API Abstraction Layer

Created a new `VehicleAPI` class in `/assets/js/vehicle-api.js` that provides:

- **Clean API Interface**: Standardized methods for vehicle data operations
- **Demo Mode Detection**: Automatically detects when no real API credentials are configured
- **Real vs Demo Transparency**: Clear indicators of data source in all responses
- **Future-Ready Structure**: Easy to swap demo implementations for real API calls

##### 2. Demo Mode Indicators

- **Visual Indicators**: All dashboard widgets show "DEMO MODE" badges when displaying simulated data
- **Data Source Labels**: Clear labeling of whether data comes from real APIs or simulation
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging of API calls and data sources for developers

#### Smartcar API Integration

##### Redirect URI

The OAuth redirect URI for Smartcar integration is:

```
https://chatala1.github.io/BMW-Concierge/smartcar/callback
```

This endpoint is configured to handle OAuth authorization callbacks from Smartcar's API.

##### Configuration

To enable Smartcar integration, update the `_config.yml` file with your Smartcar client ID:

```yaml
smartcar:
  client_id: "your-smartcar-client-id"
  redirect_uri: "https://chatala1.github.io/BMW-Concierge/smartcar/callback"
```

##### Implementation Details

The Smartcar integration provides:
- **Vehicle Authentication**: OAuth flow for vehicle access
- **Real-time Data**: Live vehicle status when connected
- **API Fallback**: Graceful degradation to demo mode when no real connection

#### API Development Guidelines

When developing with the API abstraction layer:

1. **Always Check Demo Mode**: Use the `isDemoMode()` method to determine data source
2. **Provide Fallbacks**: Ensure demo data is available for all API endpoints
3. **Label Data Sources**: Always indicate to users whether data is real or simulated
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide meaningful error messages and fallback to demo mode
