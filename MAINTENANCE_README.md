# Repository Maintenance - Branch Cleanup

This directory contains automated tools and documentation for cleaning up unnecessary branches in the BMW-Concierge repository.

## Files Included

### 1. BRANCH_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md
Comprehensive analysis document that:
- Inventories all 41 branches in the repository
- Identifies which branches are safe to delete (38 branches)
- Lists protected branches that must be preserved (main, active PR branches)
- Provides safety considerations and verification steps

### 2. BRANCH_CLEANUP_SCRIPT.sh
Automated cleanup script that:
- Safely deletes unnecessary copilot/fix-* branches
- Preserves main branch and branches with active PRs
- Creates backup files before deletion
- Provides colored output and progress tracking
- Includes safety confirmations and error handling

## Usage Instructions

### For Repository Administrators

1. **Review the Analysis**
   ```bash
   cat BRANCH_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md
   ```

2. **Execute the Cleanup**
   ```bash
   ./BRANCH_CLEANUP_SCRIPT.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Results**
   - Check that main branch functionality is intact
   - Confirm only active PR branches remain
   - Review backup files for reference

### Safety Features

- **Protected Branches**: Script will never delete main, copilot/fix-76, or copilot/fix-78
- **Backup Creation**: Creates timestamped backup of branch information
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Requires explicit user confirmation before deletion
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failed deletions and provides summary
- **Repository Verification**: Ensures script runs only on BMW-Concierge repository

### Expected Results

After cleanup:
- **Before**: 41 total branches
- **After**: 3 active branches (main + 2 active PR branches)
- **Deleted**: 38 obsolete copilot/fix-* branches

## Verification Steps

1. **Check branch count**: `git branch -r | wc -l`
2. **Verify main branch**: `git checkout main && git pull`
3. **Test site functionality**: Follow BMW-Concierge deployment verification steps
4. **Confirm PR branches**: Verify copilot/fix-76 and copilot/fix-78 still exist

## Troubleshooting

If the script encounters issues:
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have repository admin rights
- **Network issues**: Retry with stable internet connection
- **Branch protection**: Some branches may have additional protection settings

## Maintenance Schedule

Recommend running this cleanup:
- After major development cycles
- When copilot/fix-* branches accumulate (>10 branches)
- During quarterly repository maintenance

## Support

For issues with this cleanup process:
1. Review the backup files created during cleanup
2. Check the BRANCH_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md for detailed branch information
3. Contact repository administrators for manual intervention if needed
